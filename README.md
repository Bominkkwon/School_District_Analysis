## Project title
School District Analysis - Module 4 Challenge 

## Technologies
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Download Python") 3.7.9.

## Overview 
Using Pandas and Python to explore the given datasets: 1) [schools_complete.csv](https://github.com/Bominkkwon/School_District_Analysis/tree/main/Resources "Resources/schools_complete.csv"), which consists of school ID, school name, school type, size, and budget and 2) [students_complete.csv](https://github.com/Bominkkwon/School_District_Analysis/tree/main/Resources "Resources/students_complete.csv"), which consists of student ID, student name, gender, grade, school name, reading score, and math score. The results from the module give the following list of deliverables for the analysis of the school district:

* A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
* An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
* Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
* Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
* The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
* The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
* School performance based on the budget per student
* School performance based on the school size 
* School performance based on the type of school

Then the module provided additional information for the Module 4 challenge-- "students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered" and was asked replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. By repeating the school district analysis for this module after making these changes ([PyCitySchools_Challenge](https://github.com/Bominkkwon/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb)), it allows us to analyze how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Analysis


* How is the district summary affected?
* How is the school summary affected?
* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
* Math and reading scores by grade
* Scores by school spending
* Scores by school size
* Scores by school type
